# Elegy Planning

> Use when an agent needs to create, inspect, update, validate, or export durable planning state — goals, roadmaps, plans, work points, todos, issues, review points, insights, and project runs — through the dedicated `elegy-planning` CLI over SQLite.

SQLite is the durable authority. Markdown and JSON projections are
generated, derived outputs. Omitted scope defaults to `default` and
that silent default is a common source of agent mistakes — always pass
`--scope <scope-key>` explicitly.

Default storage:
- Planning DB: `~/.elegy/planning.db`.
- Session sidecar: `~/.elegy/planning-session.json`.
- Treat `.copilot` planning DB paths as historical migration inputs, not
  active authority.

## Quick start

1. Resolve the scope key. Use
   `elegy-planning --scope <scope-key> scope list --json` to confirm the
   scope exists. If the user did not name one, ask.
2. Create a goal:
   `elegy-planning --scope <scope-key> --json --non-interactive --correlation-id <id> goal create --id <slug> --title <t> --description <d> --acceptance <a> --acceptance <a> --rejection <r> --rejection <r>`.
   Repeat `--acceptance` and `--rejection` for multiple criteria. Do
   not comma-join values.
3. Add a work point to a roadmap:
   `elegy-planning --scope <scope-key> --json --non-interactive roadmap add-section --roadmap-id <r> --section-id <s>` followed by
   `roadmap add-work-point --roadmap-id <r> --work-point-id <wp> --effort-tier <fast|balanced|deep> --file-scope <type:intent:selector>`.
4. Inspect context before deep work:
   `elegy-planning --scope <scope-key> --json context --entity-type goal --entity-id <id>` to load the goal plus related insights and
   token estimates.
5. Run a full validation pass:
   `elegy-planning --scope <scope-key> --json validate all` to surface
   referential integrity issues and stale references.

## Tool-call guardrails

### Read family (goal/roadmap/plan/work-point/todo/issue/review-point
show & list, scope, search-extended, tags-list, context, work-graph,
next-runnable)

- Argument shape: `<entity> show --<entity>-id <id> --json`. The
  `--json` flag is required for machine-mode parsing; do not omit it
  even on a "quick check".
- For list commands, pass `--limit <n>` to cap the result set; the
  default limit is conservative but explicit is safer.
- `search-extended` is the only search family that supports
  `--title`, `--tag`, `--status`, and `--fts` together. Pass each
  filter as a separate flag; do not stack them in `--query`.
- `context --entity-type <type> --entity-id <id>` returns progressive
  disclosure bundles with token estimates. The estimate is
  informational; do not parse it.
- `work-graph` and `next-runnable` are read-only but can return
  large payloads; always pass `--limit` for `next-runnable` to avoid
  pulling the whole work queue.
- Side-effect class: `read_only`.
- Approval posture: `none`.

### Mutate family (create / update-status / plan-revise / insight-record)

- Always pass `--json --non-interactive --correlation-id <id>` on every
  mutating call. The CLI refuses interactive prompts when
  `--non-interactive` is set, and a missing `--correlation-id` causes
  the call to fail under machine mode. Both flags together are the
  contract.
- Multi-value flags (`--acceptance`, `--rejection`, `--tag`,
  `--file-scope`, `--related-entity`) must be **repeated** per value:
  `--acceptance <a1> --acceptance <a2>`. Comma-joining is silently
  dropped.
- `plan-revise` removal semantics: passing `--routing-hint ""` or
  omitting `--file-scopes` does **not** clear existing values. Use
  `--clear-routing-hint` and `--clear-file-scopes` to remove
  previously set values. These two flags are the only reliable way
  to clear.
- `--effort-tier` is required for `roadmap add-work-point` and
  recommended for plan and todo authoring. Valid values are
  `fast`, `balanced`, `deep`. The value affects validation depth,
  not the durable record.
- File-scope selector grammar: `<type>:<intent>:<selector>`. Types
  are `exact` or `glob`. Intents are `primary`, `review`, or
  `affected`. Example: `--file-scope glob:primary:rust/crates/elegy-contracts/**`.
- `--status` on `*-update-status` accepts the entity's lifecycle
  states (e.g. `draft`, `proposed`, `active`, `validated`,
  `invalidated`, `superseded`, `abandoned` for goals). Do not
  transition to a state the entity is not currently allowed to
  leave.
- Side-effect class: `disk_write` against the SQLite database.
- Approval posture: `advisory`. The host may require approval for
  specific transitions (e.g. `validated`, `invalidated`).

### Project-run family (claim / activate / release / add-evidence)

- `project-run-claim` is a durable lease. It is **not** a soft
  reservation; if the lease exists, the work point is considered
  in-flight until `release` is called. Always pass the full
  scope: `--goal-id`, `--roadmap-id`, `--work-point-id`, `--repo`,
  `--branch`, `--worktree`, `--session`, `--profile`.
- `project-run-add-evidence` appends evidence to a run; evidence is
  immutable once recorded. Do not "fix" a run by re-adding evidence
  — open a new run or supersede the old one.
- Side-effect class: `disk_write` plus cross-host lease visibility.
- Approval posture: `required`. The host must explicitly approve
  lease creation or release.

### Validation / health / export (validate all, health, project-export,
project-render)

- `validate all` and `health` are read-only but expensive on large
  databases. Schedule them, do not run them per-keystroke.
- `project-export` and `project-render` write to disk under the path
  passed via `--output <path>`. Confirm the path with the user
  before invoking; the file is overwritten if it exists.
- `project-export` emits JSON; `project-render` emits Markdown.
  Pick the right one for the consumer.
- Side-effect class: `disk_write` for export/render; `read_only` for
  validate/health.
- Approval posture: `advisory` for validate/health; `required` for
  export/render if the output path is outside the user's working
  directory.

## Workflow

1. Resolve scope.
   - If the user did not name a scope, call `scope list --json` and
     ask. Never let `--scope` default to `default` silently.
2. Author top-down.
   - Goal first, then roadmap, then plan, then work points, then
     todos. Authoring in this order lets `--file-scope` selectors
     reference the upstream entity and lets validation catch
     referential breaks early.
3. Record insights as you go.
   - Every time the user makes a non-obvious decision, call
     `insight record` with `--insight-type <type> --tag <tag>`. The
     next session's `context` call will surface them.
4. Validate before declaring done.
   - Run `validate all` and check that the result has no Critical
     findings. Treat High findings as blockers for a "done" claim.
5. Render or export for human consumption.
   - `project-render` for Markdown review, `project-export` for
     machine-readable handoff. The output is a derived artifact,
     not authority.

## Capability Index

The full capability index with side-effect classification is in [`references/capability-index.md`](references/capability-index.md).

Summary: 48 capabilities across read-only (27), disk_write (20), and cross-host (1).

## Output envelope

- Envelope: `planning-result/v1` (declared in
  `contracts/schemas/planning-result.schema.json`).
- `status`: `ok`, `partial`, or `error`. Partial means the call
  succeeded but some inner sub-result failed; surface the inner
  failures.
- `data`: entity payload or list of payloads, depending on the call.
- `validation`: validation findings, when the call performed any
  validation (e.g. `validate all`).
- `correlationId`: echoes the `--correlation-id` passed to the call.
  Use this for cross-call lineage.
- `error`: machine-readable error code plus human message. The
  machine code is in `error.code`; the message is in `error.message`.

## Common issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
| -- | -- | -- |
| The call returns results from a different scope than the user asked about. | `--scope` was omitted and the CLI defaulted to `default`. | Always pass `--scope <scope-key>` explicitly. The silent default is the most common planning bug. |
| `goal create` rejects the call with "missing correlation-id" even though the user did not specify one. | Machine mode requires `--correlation-id` on every mutation. | Generate a fresh id (`uuidgen` or the host's equivalent) and pass it on every mutating call. |
| `plan revise` appears to succeed but the routing hint or file scopes are not actually cleared. | Empty values are dropped; only the explicit `--clear-routing-hint` and `--clear-file-scopes` flags clear. | Add the explicit clear flags. Re-run `plan show` to confirm the cleared state. |
| Multi-value flags silently drop all but the first value. | The agent joined values with commas or `;` instead of repeating the flag. | Repeat the flag once per value. The CLI does not warn. |
| `roadmap add-work-point` rejects with "selector grammar invalid". | The `<type>:<intent>:<selector>` shape was malformed (missing colons, unknown type, unknown intent). | Re-emit with the exact grammar. Types are `exact` or `glob`. Intents are `primary`, `review`, or `affected`. |
| `context --entity-type goal --entity-id <id>` returns a huge payload. | The goal has many linked insights and a wide work graph. | Pass `--include <entity-type>[,<entity-type>...]` to narrow the bundle. The default is "all linked entities". |
| `validate all` returns Critical findings that did not exist yesterday. | A recent mutation broke referential integrity (orphan work point, dangling roadmap reference). | Re-author the broken upstream entity and re-run validation. Do not delete the broken record without surfacing it to the user first. |
| `project-run-claim` returns "lease already held". | Another session claimed the same work point. | List active runs (`project-run list`) and either wait for release, pick a different work point, or coordinate with the holding session. Do not force-release another session's lease. |
| `project-export` overwrites an existing file the user cared about. | `--output` points at an existing path and the CLI does not prompt in non-interactive mode. | Confirm the path with the user before invoking. Pick a fresh `--output` path for each export. |
| `health` shows FTS5 index drift. | The FTS5 mirror was not updated after a bulk insert. | Run the FTS5 rebuild command documented in the planning health reference, or recreate the FTS5 mirror from the source table. |
| `next-runnable` returns work points that look ready but are blocked. | The work point's upstream dependencies have not all reached `validated`. | Inspect the work graph with `work-graph`; the ready-set excludes unvalidated upstream by default but a `--include-blocked` flag changes that. |

## Version compatibility

- Minimum supported `elegy-planning` version: `0.1.0`. The CLI is
  pinned to its companion Rust workspace; check `elegy --version`
  before invoking.
- SQLite is the only durable backend in scope. There is no
  PostgreSQL or remote-database path; the host-local SQLite file is
  the source of truth.
- Semver rule: minor must be >= the version that introduced the
  capability (e.g. `planning-project-run-claim` is only present in
  versions that ship the project-run feature). Patch is unconstrained.

## Examples

### Example 1 — create a goal and a roadmap

```text
elegy-planning --scope repo:elegy --json --non-interactive \
  --correlation-id $(uuidgen) \
  goal create \
  --id skill-rename-v1 \
  --title "Rename skill-definition-v2 to skill across the repo" \
  --description "Drop the v2 suffix in filenames, manifests, and prose." \
  --acceptance "All fixtures renamed to skill.<surface>.json" \
  --acceptance "cargo test --workspace passes" \
  --rejection "v2 suffix reintroduced in any new file" \
  --tag migration --tag skills
```

Expected: `status: "ok"`, `data.goal.id = "skill-rename-v1"`,
`correlationId` echoes the input.

### Example 2 — add a work point with file scopes

```text
elegy-planning --scope repo:elegy --json --non-interactive \
  --correlation-id $(uuidgen) \
  roadmap add-work-point \
  --roadmap-id skill-rename-roadmap \
  --work-point-id update-fixtures \
  --effort-tier balanced \
  --file-scope glob:primary:contracts/fixtures/skill.*.json \
  --file-scope glob:review:contracts/manifests/*.json
```

Expected: `status: "ok"`, `data.workPoint.fileScopes` lists both
selectors in declaration order.

### Example 3 — clear file scopes on a plan

```text
elegy-planning --scope repo:elegy --json --non-interactive \
  --correlation-id $(uuidgen) \
  plan revise \
  --plan-id update-fixtures \
  --clear-file-scopes
```

Expected: `status: "ok"`, `data.plan.fileScopes = []`. Re-running
`plan show` should confirm the empty list.

## Boundaries

- This skill owns: durable planning records (goals, roadmaps, plans,
  work points, todos, issues, review points, insights, project runs)
  and their SQLite storage.
- This skill does not own: vault operations, repo operations, agent
  host projection, or MCP tool registration. Those live in their
  own skills.
- This skill does not own: planning state on other systems. Even when
  another system mirrors planning state, the SQLite file under the
  active scope is authority.
- Companion skills:
  - `elegy-memory` — for facts, preferences, and procedural
    memories that span planning sessions.
  - `elegy-obsidian` — for vault-side mirrors; planning is the
    authority and Obsidian is the read/write target.
  - `elegy-skills` — for registry operations; planning does not
    register skills.
  - `elegy-skill-authoring` — for SKILL.md audit and review.
